# gugaGame

This is a simple arcade game created for the "Game Programming" subject in college.  
The idea was to resolve a exercise where I needed to create a game with a "racket", where it should have hits and misses scores, sounds and use the "oCanvas" lib.  
The name is inspired in the brazillian tennins player "Guga" :grin:
